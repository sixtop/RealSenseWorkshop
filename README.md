APPLICABLE LICENSES

See license contained in this zip file.

DESCRIPTION

This code sample uses the Intel® RealSense™ SDK for Windows* to explore the facial recognition capabilities of the developer kit. It explores the following facial recognition actions:

* Detect the number of faces in view of the camera.
* Register and unregister users
* Capture an image of the user upon registration
* Create, read, update and delete (CRUD) a recognition database

NOTES

1. The full functionality of this sample app requires a front-facing 3D camera.
2. This project uses an explicit path to libpxcclr.cs.dll (the managed RealSense DLL): C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\RSSDK\bin\x64. This reference will need to be changed if your installation path is different.
